# Hello

A pretty simple node.js application. Gotta start some place.

- - -

As noted in [the main README](../README.md), this sample has two pieces:

- a `build` script which will build the container image(s) used
- a `run` script which deploys resources that use those images

The main purpose of this example is the `run` script, but the `build`
script is included for complete educational (and reuse) purposes.
